* [example_gptrigger.vbs](example_gptrigger.vbs) - This script is designed to run from [Cisco's AnyConnect VPN Client](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/anyconnect-secure-mobility-client-v4-x/model.html).  Upon connection to the VPN Concentrator, the script is downloaded to the client and executed.  This particular script is designed to check if the user and system are part of Example (fictitious organization).  If yes, and the user is in the correct container then a group policy update is initiated and its status recorded.  Detailed logging is kept allowing examination of the application event log to determine why a user & system were or weren't eligible.
